### Business Recommendations
1. Due to the minimum temperature of December being 8 degrees less than June, the Surf Shop may want to stock clothing items and accessories that would be typically used. 
2. Although we may want to increase inventories of products that are more in line with colder weather in December, due to the max temperatures of both months only 2 degrees apart, we may want to maintain items not associated with colder weather instead of reducing that line of business.
